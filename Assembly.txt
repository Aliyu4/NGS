#velveth is algorithm for hash/kmer generation in velvet program.
#foldername can be any output folder name in which you store data. If this name is not given file will get stored in present directory.
#41 is kmer length. Velvet comes with by-default maximum 31kmer length. This can be changed during installation. 
#For velvet you need to tell the program file format & type of input file. So that it can distinguish between different file formats.

		velvetg output_directory -min_contig_lgth 100 –exp¬_cov auto

#velveth is algorithm for making contigs in velvet program.
#min_contig_lgth this should must be greater than kmer length. So that contigs can be made using overlaps.
